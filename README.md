Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is RÃ©ka HajdÃº
===========================

I finished my studies at John von Neumann University GAMF Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science in February of 2024 and I started working as a front end webdeveloper

I always wanted to do a creative job growing up and the creation via code became my dream. I'm mostly interested in web development, but I'm interested in mobile development too

In my free time I like to read in English to strengthen my vocabulary, I taught myself video editing with CapCut and I plan to learn how to make digital art
