Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is RÃ©ka HajdÃº
===========================

I finished my studies at John von Neumann University GAMF Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science in February of 2024 and I started working as a front-end web developer since then.

I always wanted to do a creative job growing up and the creation via code became my dream. I'm mostly focused on web development, but I'm interested in mobile development too.
