Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is RÃ©ka HajdÃº
===========================

Currently studying at John von Neumann University GAMF Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. I started my programming studies in September 2021 

Frontend development is what I'm most interested in and like to work with in the future. I always wanted a creative job where I can make my ideas real. I'm not good at painting, writing or drawing. So coding is my form of art
