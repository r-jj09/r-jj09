Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is RÃ©ka HajdÃº
===========================

I finished my studies at John von Neumann University GAMF Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science in February 2024 and have been working as a front-end web developer since then.

Growing up, I always wanted to do a creative job, and creating via code became my dream. I'm mostly focused on web development, but I'm interested in mobile development, too.
